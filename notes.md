training a simple 1v1 small drylands map. max 10 turns

going with 25 mcts for ok depth and search. usually the best moves are always the first few available.

using complex action mapper because the legal moves generation is always different and indexed in different orders. deterministic != psudo-random (basically)

self play formula for eco and mil is crucial

proper type mapping is crucial

mcts uses only win policy, which is fine for now.

mil and eco are used to guide the model

training with FOW ENABLED. maximum difficulty for ai but will trail a lot smarter.
will prevent the ai from lerning FOWless behaviour and strategies.

allow panicing, encourage it. this will trigger bugs.

the simulator is "perfect" it will not error unless some bug occurs.

the legal move generator perfectly generates legal moves so .execute shouldn't in theory panic

target_index is used by economy moves, mostly
and src_index is used by army moves, mostly

just spent 20k ARS in runpod. referral got meself ~+10 USD for free


IM ENABLING FOW AGAIN!!

im guessing it will increase the complexity but will eventually line up with what truly matters.
fow disabled = cheating (basically)

adding heuristics to guide model, and self play


early turns dont require such deep mcts.
mcts requires dynamic depth.

polytopia has a narrower but much deeper search tree per turn compared to Chess
you must look ~8 steps deep just to complete one game turn
